# AsyncPropertyTesting

Give hell to your concurrent code :)

This library was inspired by Antonio Scandurra's talk [Property-testing async code in Rust to build reliable distributed systems](https://youtu.be/ms8zKpS_dZE). Other prior art from the Rust ecosystem includes [turmoil](https://github.com/tokio-rs/turmoil), [loom](https://github.com/tokio-rs/loom), and [shuttle](https://github.com/awslabs/shuttle).
